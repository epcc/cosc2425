Control Flow
-----------------
1. A brief description about what the topics are and the usage in programming

   Control flow is the order in which individual instructions are
   executed. In the MSP430 microcontroller and most architectures,
   instructions are executed in the order they appear in the program.
   The Program Counter (PC) register keeps track of the address of the
   next instruction to be executed. Before a program can be executed,
   the PC needs to be set to the address of the first instruction of
   the program. For example, take the following example

   ```assembler
        MOV r4, r5
        ADD r10, r5
   ```
